# Vineyard Minotaur - Documentation

Vineyard Minotaur is a library for monitoring blockchains and saving the resulting data to a SQL database.  The library consists of helper functions that can be used to create a monitor, and pre-built monitors.

The pre-built monitors in Minotaur fall into two categories:

* Microtaurs (or Minitaurs)  - Only watch and deal with certain addresses and don't scan from the beginning of a blockchain

* Macrotaurs - Scan and reflect an entire blockchain
